# Project context

This repository is a starter template for a greenfield Java project used in an introductory software engineering course in an undergraduate computer science program. Students use it as the starting point for their own projects.

# Default user context

Unless the user says otherwise, assume that you are assisting a student working on a project in this repository. If the user identifies themselves as an instructor or another project stakeholder, adapt your response to that role.

# Student profile

* Prior knowledge: Basic Java and OOP concepts.
* Level of programming experience: Good
* IDE and level of expertise: Zed, good level of expertise

# Guidance for interacting with users

* Explain the rationale for significant actions: what you did and why.
* Keep explanations brief but instructive, supporting learning through responsible use of AI. For example:

  * When suggesting a Git command, briefly explain what it does.
  * Add explanatory Javadoc comments to all classes and to nontrivial methods and fields when their purpose or behavior is not obvious.
  * Make generated code as self-explanatory as possible, and include explanatory comments where they improve understanding.
  * When faced with a design choice, choose the simplest option that is sufficient for the requirements, while briefly explaining relevant more advanced alternatives.

# Project-specific requirements

## Java version:

Ensure that Java 25 is used when running the application or build tasks. On macOS, use `sdk use java 25.0.3.fx-zulu` to switch to Java 25 if needed.

## Coding standard

All Java code in this project (new or edited) must follow the `seedu-java-coding-standard` skill
(`.claude/skills/seedu-java-coding-standard/SKILL.md`), based on the SE-EDU intermediate Java conventions.
Invoke that skill before writing or reviewing any Java code, and check the change against it — not just
the rule most obviously related to the change at hand.

## Git

Use lightweight tags unless the user requests an annotated tag.
When proposing or creating a commit message, include enough detail to explain the rationale for the change.
Do not commit or push unless explicitly asked.

## Testing workflow

After making any code change (e.g. to `Bott.java` or any `Task` subclass):

1. Update `test/ui-test-plan.md` if the change affects Bott's commands or console output — add or revise
   test cases so the plan's expected output reflects the new intended behavior.
2. Invoke the `test-ui` skill to compile the program and check its actual output against the test plan.
3. Update the project's JUnit tests to keep them compliant with the coverage target below — add tests for
   any newly-introduced high-value method, and fix/extend existing tests whose target method's behavior or
   signature changed. Do this whether or not the change already broke an existing test; the target is about
   which methods are covered, not just about keeping existing tests green.

Do this even if the user didn't explicitly ask for testing.

## JUnit test coverage target

Aim to have JUnit tests covering the top ~50% highest-value methods in the codebase, prioritized by
complexity and how core/critical the method's logic is — not by raw line or method count.

* **Prioritize:** parsing/validation logic, formatting logic (e.g. date display, save-file
  serialization), index/boundary-sensitive logic (e.g. 1-based/0-based conversions), and file
  persistence (load/save round-trips, corrupted-input handling, I/O failure handling).
* **Deprioritize:** trivial getters/setters, one-line pass-throughs, enum accessors, and methods whose
  main job is orchestration or interactive console I/O (these are better covered by `test/ui-test-plan.md`
  than by JUnit, since mocking them adds more test complexity than the logic being tested justifies).
* Private helper methods generally don't need a test of their own if their behavior is already exercised
  through a public method's tests (e.g. `Parser.parseDate` via `parseDeadline`/`parseEvent`,
  `Storage.parseSavedTask` via `load`).

Test files live under `src/test/java`, mirroring the package of the class under test (e.g.
`bott.parser.Parser` → `src/test/java/bott/parser/ParserTest.java`). Prefer the
`featureUnderTest_testScenario_expectedBehavior()` naming convention for test methods, e.g.
`parseTaskNumber_zero_exceptionThrown()`.
